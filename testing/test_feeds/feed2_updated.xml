					<description><![CDATA[<p>@madroutine @madroutine I&#8217;ve been working really hard on filling my sketchbook lately! It&#8217;s been a super duper fun project and it allows me to work on art on a more casual and consistent basis without having to whip out the whole digital art setup and process, which can be, well&#8230; quite the process. Sometimes its nice to just sketch and not have super high expectations or complicated executions. Although for a while I was thinking, &#8220;there&#8217;s no way this sketchbook will be better than my last one (my favorite sketchbook from senior year).&#8221; And after flipping through my last sketchbook&#8230; i can confidently say this new one is worlds better. Like holy crap. I&#8217;m SO excited to do a sketchbook tour video of this sketchbook once its done. And that&#8217;s actually a big motivator for me to keep working on it consistently &#8211; which is great!! It also gives me the opportunity to draw my characters which I&#8217;ve not drawn in AGES. Altho there is still so many I have to draw!! Maybe not drawing the same OCs over and over will help&#8230; I already have four different drawings of Marina in here&#8230; (Marina is the scene girl in the last photo. she&#8217;s a badass android military bodyguard.) One issue with this sketchbook though, is the size. I actually got a smaller size than I thought because I&#8217;m stupid and didn&#8217;t check the measurements before ordering, assuming I was getting the same size as my last Moleskine. Well, this one&#8217;s around 3.5 x 5 inches, and I actually ended up really liking the smaller size of it cause it&#8217;s more compact. It works. BUT, the small pages makes it really hard to draw certain things, like multiple subjects on one page or even full bodies. I noticed that I&#8217;ve been mostly drawing portraits and have had to make a conscious effort to draw half or full bodies, or just more complex compositions in general. On one hand, it doesn&#8217;t really matter, and I want to allow myself to draw in a way that is easy and comfortable for me, so I don&#8217;t frustrate myself, but I also want to nudge myself a little &#8211; challenge myself to do things that are outside my comfort zone. So my next pages will definitely be a reflection of that, hopefully. And I also need to seriously draw some OCs that I WANT to draw and just haven&#8217;t. But besides that&#8230; I LOVE MY SKETCHBOOK!!!!! (˶°ㅁ°)!!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Full Name: Hunter Memphis Alatorre Jr. Title: Silverlobo Nickname: Memphis Age: 31 Height: 6&#8217;3&#8243; Gender: Man Species: Blueport Human Power/Curse: Deadtime &#8211; momentarily slow down time and become unseen. Weapon: Revolver / Vista Komplex 5408-MED (Matrix Emulation Device) Nationality: American Ethnicity: Mexican-American Birthplace: New Mexico, USA, Blueport Spoken Languages: English Interests/Hobbies/Likes: Playing guitar, singing, exploring nature, netrunning, trying new foods, programming, coffee, snakes, goth fashion. Affiliation/Occupation: Cybercowboy mercenary Location: Chyro 7, Japan, Blueport Memphis with his cyberdeck. Personality: Memphis has grown to be a hardened, quiet man shaped by his experiences with loss and betrayal. He can appear rough-edged, intimidating, yet calm and collected all at once. He&#8217;s stoic, dry &#8211; but not afraid to relax and crack witty jokes around people he likes. He wears a front of stoicism, an appearance of put-togetherness, but beneath the surface simmers deeply suppressed rage and regret. He&#8217;s loyal to those he trusts, but he&#8217;s hard to reach emotionally. He keeps a distance, afraid of losing anyone he truly lets in. Memphis fights for his cause through painful strain, with that ever-burning desperate belief that justice is still possible for him, and everyone else he ever cared for, even if he has to burn everything down to get it. Strengths: Intelligent, unrelenting determination, calm under pressure, skilled at netrunning, stealth, and cybercombat.

Backstory:  [Content warning: Domestic violence, intense violence, substance abuse] Hunter Memphis Alatorre Jr. grew up in desolate Silver City, New Mexico. His early years growing up with his parents and younger sister Molly, along with a struggling local economy, job market, and increasing crime rates never made survival easy. Memphis always felt the urge to help support his family, especially to protect Molly. He took up small gigs and part time jobs to help with money ever since he turned 15. His work ethic extended to his school life, where he relentlessly studied and aced his classes, more so out of necessity than of interest in learning. Memphis and Molly always were under pressure to get good grades and head off to college by their parents for a chance at a better life. But they were always in it together. He was a role model to Molly, and Memphis wanted to be a good one. He found interest in programming during his later school years &#8211; it was something he loved to learn in his free time, which came sparingly. Anything within computer science would always be his best subject. During junior year, he found a group of friends in his programming class who introduced him to playing guitar. Lex, Edwardo, and Andre all had a passion for making music, and soon Memphis would join the three boys to form the band &#8220;Silverlobos&#8221;, playing mostly mediocre-sounding alternative western rock. Memphis found an escape in his new hobby, a way to temporarily forget about the stress of life. He loved to sing and play guitar, especially as a way to write about his life. But his time was not easy to manage, and he often found himself coming home from work, band gigs, or study sessions at midnight hours, completely passed out the second he stepped foot through the door. He hardly had time to spend with Molly these days, either. She always missed him. After graduating high school, Memphis dropped the college scholarships that he earned for something even better &#8211; a full time job at Maelstrom, the leading corporation for military-grade cyberware, and he would finally get the opportunity to let his programming skills shine. His computer science teacher &#8211; a former employee &#8211; referred him to the corp, and after seeing how well he excelled at the subject, they decided to scout him into the company before any others could grab him. Memphis moved to Chyro-7, Japan to be closer to work and to escape his dreaded hometown. Molly moved in with him into their cramped downtown apartment, as she found herself working for Maelstrom, too, as an accountant. Memphis actually referred Molly to the company, knowing she was struggling to find work the first few months after graduation. She was just the right fit, too &#8211; crunching data and numbers was always her thing. Memphis&#8217; first year was a grueling initiation into the company. He barely had time to be a human, and he felt more like a machine that built other machines for a while. A year in, Edwardo joined him as a colleague, while Lex and Andre began work at a different chrome corporation in Chyro-7. The first few years were tough &#8211; long work hours, stressful office environment, and annoying upper management. But Edwardo was there to help keep his sanity. Memphis and the rest of Silverlobos continued to play when they could, and after the grueling initiation-phase of work began to wane, the four men finally had more free time again, even improving their music together ten-fold. Together, they slowly climbed the corpo-ladder and earned themselves more days off and bigger paychecks. Memphis, for the first time in his life, felt like he had time to breathe. He could allocate a few hours each day to his band, to socialize, and even to rest. His</p>

									<p><strong>Personality: </strong>Memphis has grown to be a hardened, quiet man shaped by his experiences with loss and betrayal. He can appear rough-edged, intimidating, yet calm and collected all at once. He&#8217;s stoic, dry &#8211; but not afraid to relax and crack witty jokes around people he likes. He wears a front of stoicism, an appearance of put-togetherness, but beneath the surface simmers deeply suppressed rage and regret. He&#8217;s loyal to those he trusts, but he&#8217;s hard to reach emotionally. He keeps a distance, afraid of losing anyone he truly lets in.

He barely had time to be a human, and he felt more like a machine that built other machines for a while.

Memphis, for the first time in his life, felt like he had time to breathe. He could allocate a few hours each day to his band, to socialize, and even to rest. His work was more fulfilling, too, as he got to engineer new innovative cyberware with his team. He even got his first implant to improve his work &#8211; replacing his right arm with a fully decked out silver sleeve of chrome. These improvements didn&#8217;t come without sacrifices, though, as Molly and Memphis&#8217; relationship began to heavily strain. Work life and sharing the same tiny apartment lead to ugly, tired arguments that left no time for closure. They began to drift apart again and planned to move into separate places to give each other space.</p><p>And then, Molly vanished.</p><p>No note, no message &#8211; gone without a trace.</p><p>Her stuff was left exactly as it always was, frozen in time, and slowly, Memphis&#8217; world paused too. He began to unravel, frequent mental breakdowns, freakouts, and panic attacks. He begged Maelstrom for help, non-stop calling HR, C7PD, even private investigators that all seemed to be completely incompetent. No one listened, especially not at Maelstrom, and his higher-ups were nearly impossible to reach. Edwardo tried to help, but couldn&#8217;t do much either &#8211; giving up quickly, along with everyone else. The rest of the band weren&#8217;t of much help either &#8211; too busy with their own lives and jobs. The case went cold as weeks of searching turned to months, months to years. He was left with nothing &#8211; no answers, no leads, no idea if she was even dead or alive. </p><p>Memphis fell into a deep depression, worsened by the growing distance between him and his bandmates. His work struggled and he slowly drops music altogether. Eventually, Maelstrom fires him. He hardly cares &#8211; spending the last days of his apartment&#8217;s lease sleeping and suppressing his pain with hard drugs and alcohol.  Naturally, he gets kicked out and thrown out into the cold, grimy streets. Memphis spends the next few months bar-hopping and staying in hotels. Back in survival mode, he gets the chance to forget about Molly for a while as he puts his focus into finding gigs again. This time, he won&#8217;t settle for retail  or deliveries, though. He goes for cyberspace. Netrunning was a skill he became proficient at during his years at Maelstrom, and his most valuable possession outside of his music equipment, which he all sold except for his guitar, was his cyberdeck. A custom rig based on the Vista Komplex 5408-MED.</p><p>Eventually, Memphis stumbles upon a fixer by the name of Aerol in a bar he frequents. Aerol sees Memphis in the corner of the bar working on his deck, walks up to him and after a quick introduction, simply offers up a job he describes as &#8220;easy&#8221; contract work in cyberspace: some men need to be taken care of from the inside out. Digital death. Possibly some of the most challenging things to accomplish in a virtual environment, but Memphis takes the job in a heartbeat. He gets it done clean and fast. Without time to spare, Aerol kept the work coming. Slowly, Memphis began to pick himself up from the hole he fell into. He got a new apartment, moved back in all his stuff he&#8217;s been lugging around in suitcases, and dedicated a small space for Molly&#8217;s stuff, too. </p><p>Eight years pass by, Molly still missing. Memphis spent those years living up to his new title as a mercenary cybercowboy. He spent those years solo, living more in cyberspace than in reality. His work was never clean, mostly involving target elimination, stealing data, and other shady biz, but it allowed him to live comfortably. Bigger gigs even paid significantly better than his old job at Maelstrom. His biggest strength outside of his netrunning proficiency was his power, Deadtime, which for the most part, greatly aided him during combat and stealth missions. </p><p>Silverlobos has long since disbanded. Memphis lost touch with his mates, and doesn&#8217;t play guitar much anymore either. Although on some occasions he&#8217;ll go up to his apartment&#8217;s rooftop and play a mellow tune, mostly thinking about Molly while doing so. He picked up a habit of drinking and smoking, and on the days where his mind is completely spiraling, will opt for his choice of reckless night-clubbing and hard drugs. He found a few friends that he occasionally hangs out with that he met at bars and clubs, but none he could call close. His life truly stopped that day that Molly vanished. And finding her became the one reason Memphis held on to in order to keep going. </p><p>Autumn came onto Chryo-7, and Aerol contacted Memphis for yet another contract. This time, he&#8217;ll be stealing an engram stored in a corpo tower. Maelstrom&#8217;s tower. He hasn&#8217;t even so much as looked at that building since the day they threw him out. For once, Memphis feels reluctant, but accepts the job anyway.</p><p>That bitter-cold night, he infiltrates the tower and sneaks through back entrances while disarming Maelstrom security systems, all while connected to Aerol through comms, carefully listening to his guidance. It&#8217;s a delicate mission, and Aerol only went to Memphis for it because of his personal knowledge of the building&#8217;s intricate network systems and hidden passageways. Memphis finds his way to the engram, which was stored on a five-pound brick of a hard drive. He began making his way to Aerol so he could reconstruct the engram, but the comms cut out. Aerol&#8217;s position was compromised, meaning Memphis had to reconstruct it on his own. Aerol cut back in, trying to explain what to do, but mid-way through the process, the building was swarmed with security forces and Memphis had to make a run for it. Meanwhile, the reconstruction already began, and without being supplied a data point to tether to, like a virtual emulation of a brain, the engram instead tethered to Memphis&#8217; &#8211; spawning Trinity, or at least,  part of her. Trinity was once a skilled runner herself, more publicly known as the legendary Peacefighter-netrunner who was captured by Maelstrom.</p><p>Once Memphis made it back to his car, rain pouring down as he frantically drove through the streets and onto the highway, Trinity awoke and erupted in rage &#8211; wreaking havoc onto Memphis and nearly causing an accident. She was digitized, yet a holographic-like form of her appeared alongside Memphis. She couldn&#8217;t travel far from his side, yet she tried. She kicked and pulled and screamed until she couldn&#8217;t breathe. Memphis held on for dear life as they ran back into his apartment, Trinity forcefully pulled by his side. It took a few hours for the two of them to settle out of their physical fight, which sizzled into a heated argument, until finally, silence. Trinity and Memphis eventually calmed down enough to introduce themselves and explain each of their situations to each other, but meanwhile, Aerol was nowhere to be found &#8211; not after receiving fifteen calls from Memphis, demanding an explanation. Beat up with an empty hard drive, no word from his fixer, but at least now he has a digital girl to follow him around completely unwillingly. </p><p>Months pass as the two runners get acquainted with each other. Trinity mostly spends her time deep within the recesses of Memphis&#8217; mind &#8211; sometimes accessing his body through a forced conscious switch, or sometimes by asking nicely. She keeps to herself and tries to mind her business, but will occasionally summon her holo-form at curious situations. The awkward part is that others can see her, and she can&#8217;t help but to laugh at Memphis&#8217; embarrassment at the situation. The entirety of their dynamic is often times confusing, messy, and very inconvenient, but there are rare moments where the two of them can co-exist in peace. Mostly during missions &#8211; where they are at most harmony with each other. All qualms about &#8220;personal space&#8221; or &#8220;privacy&#8221; disappear as the two jack in to cyberspace together. They actually make a near-perfect pair of cybercriminals, which led to more and more gigs. The two of them became an unlikely powerhouse, with Trinity&#8217;s intel and netrunning expertise complementing Memphis&#8217; skills as a cybercowboy perfectly.</p><p>At some point, Aerol returned too, with a lengthy story about being captured and tortured by Maelstrom while also somehow escaping. Good news was that he was back with more gigs for Memphis and his new partner. Bad news was that he had no idea how to untether Trinity &#8211; so now that was in their hands to solve. The two of them worked well together but still fought often. When they did, the arguments always became heated and violent &#8211; Trinity being the instigator most of the time. She was able to hurt Memphis a lot easier since she was basically a part of his own brain. The main reason for her violent outbursts was that before she was captured by Maelstrom, she uploaded her conscious into her data fortress, where it now lies dormant. Meanwhile, the engram Maelstrom made of her mind slowly corrupted due to its artificial and inhumane environment. This part of her mind changed a lot for the worse, and deep down, she was fully aware of it without a way of stopping the deterioration. Memphis and Trinity work to figure out a way to reunite her physical body and her two halves.</p><p>After spending six months with Trinity, Memphis meets Gianni Amato at a bustling cyberrock night club known as &#8220;Reflection,&#8221; where he gets introduced to a whole new group of cyberpunks, runners, and rockerboys like him. They were part of a small but growing org, lead by a respected fixer he has yet to meet. But he finds solace in visiting Reflection every other night, spending some normal hours with his new friends, especially growing close with Gianni, who shares a lot of his interests and even sparked his motivation to pick up his guitar again. Not long after, Gianni formally introduces him to Zvezda, the leader of the org, who has some contract work for Memphis. These paid highly, but were far more dangerous. With Trinity, though, it was possible.</p><p>Weeks pass and Memphis, Trinity, and Zvezda grow a more personal bond with each other. Jobs from Zvezda didn&#8217;t come often, so they mostly got to spend time together doing other things, becoming friends after a while, hanging at each other&#8217;s apartments. There was a night where the three of them sat together, playfully bickering back and forth as usual, where out of nowhere, Memphis went silent at a comment Trinity made at him. He hardly remembered what she said &#8211; all he could think of now was of his sister. Molly. He stared back at Trinity and then walked out, excusing himself to the bathroom. Later, Memphis and Trinity returned to their apartment where she questioned him, feeling embarrassed at his reaction. Memphis blew up at her, pissed off about what she said &#8211; but this time he revealed something he never spoke to her about before. Trinity reminded him of Molly. The long, dark hair. The big, wandering eyes. He almost saw her in the same way as his little sister. Which weirdly, slightly comforted him, but mostly haunted him. It freaked him out, followed by anger and sadness. The argument worsened, bringing up the resentment the two felt about the situation they were in. Memphis just wished he didn&#8217;t even have to deal with her &#8211; and Trinity shot back to blame him, noting who got them into this mess in the first place. Trinity was already too upset to reason with, and their argument spiraled and spiraled. Yelling and tears came until Memphis, in attempt to quiet Trinity, began repeatedly hitting himself in the head with the cylinder of his revolver, disrupting her signal to him. She begged, yelling at him to stop, then vanished for a while, recessing into the mind. Memphis cried on the sofa, head in hands, but Trinity came back not long after &#8211; this time her corrupted conscious awakened at full force. She fried his neural link with a temp-EMP, disorienting him as sharp pain shot through his head &#8211; she kicked him around until he was sobbing on the floor. This was rock bottom for them. The worst their fights have ever gotten. Not a word was uttered for weeks, and Trinity seemingly ceased to exist, opting to stay dormant in the mind. Memphis still felt her lingering presence internally, but she said nothing to him and his silence followed. </p><p>Memphis woke up one morning to see Trinity leaned up against the living room wall, next to Molly&#8217;s corner of the house. She was smoking a cigarette. Not something she did regularly. They eventually managed to sit down together and talk through their feelings &#8211; complicated fucking feelings. Memphis opened up about his sister, which was cathartic for him. Something he desperately needed all these years. Trinity apologized, as did he. She opted to help find Molly, especially after all of Memphis&#8217; efforts to help her own situation. The two realized they couldn&#8217;t do this alone anymore &#8211; they had to work together to truly make any progress. </p><p>During one of their gigs for Zvezda months later, Memphis found himself back at Maelstrom&#8217;s data fortress, deep in the recesses of cyberspace. They were stealing some intel &#8211; mostly simple stuff, but meanwhile, Trinity decided to dig through their locked up files and stumbled upon one titled &#8220;Molly Anne Alatorre.&#8221;</p><p>She kept reading: &#8220;Associate <a rel="tag" class="hashtag u-tag u-category" href="https://luvstarkei.com/tag/1/">#1</a>,917 &#8211; Accountant <a rel="tag" class="hashtag u-tag u-category" href="https://luvstarkei.com/tag/433/">#433</a> &#8211; Eliminated as an eye witness to incident <a rel="tag" class="hashtag u-tag u-category" href="https://luvstarkei.com/tag/791bd/">#791BD</a> in meeting office H12 &#8211; 9/20/XXXX &#8211; Taken care of by upper management.&#8221;</p><p>Trinity audibly gasped, but before she could even decide what to do next, Memphis came to her side, reading the file she propped up in shock. He fell over, his heart dropping as his blood turned cold. He was utterly speechless.</p><p>He jacked out. Trinity followed.</p><p>Back on the cold, familiar floor of his apartment, Trinity crawled over to Memphis and held him tightly, tears rolling down her face. They sat silently for a solid ten minutes before Memphis uttered something.</p><p>He told her, &#8220;Deep down I always knew she wouldn&#8217;t ever come back. Didn&#8217;t ever come to mind, this. Just couldn&#8217;t bare to even think it.&#8221;</p><p>He choked as his throat tightened.</p><p>Trinity paused, then spoke, &#8220;They killed her to cover up a murder in that meeting room. There was a short description that I don&#8217;t think you read. Five others died, Memphis. Innocent workers. The CEO was the killer. Jack Brauffman. Fucking psychopath.&#8221; </p><p>Memphis stood up. He said nothing &#8211; wiped his face, grabbed his revolver and burst out the door. Trinity followed him in confusion as he refused to speak. She recessed and quietly watched from inside as Memphis drove and pulled up to the Maelstrom tower, staring up at the top again. There was rage ignited all over his body. He infiltrated the building and went on a midnight killing spree within each floor, carefully eliminating each target by their role. All upper management. No workers. They were all long-gone by this hour, and he shot every last bullet he carried until blood soaked into every last inch of tile cracks and dreary carpet. Trinity helped protect him from the sidelines with external hacks and EMPs, but eventually she forced control of Memphis&#8217; body completely before he could reach the top of the tower, putting his conscious to sleep. She backed away from the mess he made and sneaked out of the building as C7PD and countless more Maelstrom corpo-scum swarmed the tower.</p><p>Back home, Memphis woke up, dizzy and cold. He sat up in bed, next to Trinity who sat with her knees against her chest as she had another smoke. Her eyes were truly empty.</p><p>He screamed, agonizingly. </p><p>Memphis was never the same after that night. All these years of hope of finding his sister were taken from him in an instant. That fucking corporation stole her life and his along with it. Finally radicalized into the cause Trinity was fighting all along, now Memphis wants nothing more than to burn that corporation to the ground. And anyone ever associated with it. Maybe even his old colleagues. Maybe even himself.</p><p><!-- notionvc: 6dcfe6c8-8f23-4788-be3a-420e199ef148 --></p>								</div>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Have been working on the final preparations for my merch which will drop on 6/29/25, Sunday!!!! EEEEEEEP! I did a photoshoot with a super fancy camera which was pretty awesome since all my usual pics/recordings are either taken on a shitty flip phone camera, a shitty webcam, or a &#8220;decent but certainly not great&#8221; camera!! I also spent hours putting together all the listings, figuring out shipping (my least favorite part ever, but I got it down) And also planning what sort of fun goodies to include with the orders!! With my keychains and stickers, I&#8217;ll be including some fun stuff, but unfortunately I can&#8217;t do that with the apparel merch cause it&#8217;s being shipped by another company, not me ;-; Anyway this whole process has been SO much fun but at the same time kinda stressful as anyone could expect. I&#8217;m just super happy with how this first drop came out, so I hope once it goes live, you love it too! &#60;3 If you can&#039;t buy merch, don&#039;t worry!! I made my Star Cadet hotbar texture pack just for that occasion, 100% free for all my lovely star cadets &#60;33 (https://luvstarkei.com/product/luvstars-star-cadet-hotbar/)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>HAII, some things i wanna share that i love right now. first, harney &#38; sons victorian london fog tea. i recently bought some to try and i FREAKING LOVE IT. its 100% the best tea ive ever had. next time imma buy the loose leaf version of it tho, its way cheaper. sooooo delicious! i love tea time! planning on making some kanelbullar tomorrow so we can have fika!!!!!!! also, a viewer of mine left a comment telling me about the redux plugin for youtube&#8230;. check it out &#8211; IT BRINGS BACK THE OLD LAYOUT OF YOUTUBE!!!! i love it so much. honestly the current YT layout is&#8230; *fine* but this one is so much better and more nostalgic. but i like the home feed layout with redux, cause its way less flashy and in your face. makes the feed look more like a catalogue. lastly, some new EDM songs for the summer &#8211; &#8220;shot caller (matrix &#38; futurebound remix)&#8221; by the ian carey project. SO GOOD!!! its really upbeat and energetic drum &#38; bass.</p>
