# Crownana rss subscription service

Years ago, Google took down their free service that allowed blog site operators to turn their rss feeds into easy email subscriptions via a widget.

This is my replacement solution. Made for my own site crownanabread.com, but available for anyone to use.

### A different approach to development

For this project, I decided to take an approach I haven't taken to development before. I've decided to give true test driven development a try. Usually when I work, I start with a MVP (minimum viable product), then work my way up from there with tests as an extra nice-to-have. This time around I've decided to build up something very well thought out from the start and write tests for each essential piece as I go. Then once everything is ready, I'll throw an http service in front of my already well-constructed and tested functions.
