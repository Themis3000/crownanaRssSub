# Crownana rss subscription service

Years ago, Google took down their free service that allowed blog site operators to turn their rss feeds into easy email subscriptions via a widget.

This is my replacement solution. Made for my own site crownanabread.com, but available for anyone running a small personal blog to use. (made for use on the indeweb)

The setup is only 1 step. Just insert the html code into your site, and the rest handles it's self.

Complete with email confirmation on signup and a 1 click unsubscription process, users aren't able to abuse the subscription system and won't feel spammed by messages.
